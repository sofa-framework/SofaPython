# SofaPython (Python 2.7)

_! This plugin is not supported since the v20.12 release of SOFA !_

The goal of this plugin is to provide python integration into SOFA. Therefore, it is possible to add new features in SOFAwithout
modifying SOFAcodebase. Moreover, python scripts are stored in the same place as the corresponding scene, for a cleaner integration of scene-specific code without polluting the rest of SOFAcodebase.

This plugin provides a Sofa module available from python scripts, to interact with SOFA.
